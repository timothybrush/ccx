# CCX Desktop

CCX Desktop is a local management client for end users. You can complete installation, key setup, service management, channel setup, and client integration from the desktop app.

Recommended user path:

**Install → Configure key → Start service → Agent configuration → Add channels → Verify requests**

## Install

### Download

Windows users are recommended to prefer the Microsoft Store build when available. The Store handles signing and auto updates.

If you are a developer or cannot use the Store, download the platform package from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/BenedictKing/ccx/releases):

| Platform | File name pattern |
|----------|------------------|
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `CCX-Desktop-{version}-darwin-arm64.dmg` |
| macOS (Intel) | `CCX-Desktop-{version}-darwin-amd64.dmg` |
| Windows (GitHub) | `CCX-Desktop-{version}-windows-{arch}-setup.exe` |
| Windows (Store/MSIX) | `CCX-Desktop-{version}-windows-{arch}-store.msix` |
| Linux | `CCX-Desktop-{version}-linux-amd64.AppImage` |

The `*-store.msix` package is mainly for Microsoft Store submission and verification. Public installs should prefer the Store. Direct sideloading of `.msix` may still require a trusted signing environment.

You can verify the download with the `.sha256` file from the same release:

```bash
shasum -a 256 -c CCX-Desktop-*.sha256
```

### Installation steps

#### macOS

1. Open the `.dmg` file.
2. Drag `CCX Desktop` into `Applications`.
3. On first launch, macOS may show an unverified developer warning. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway**.

#### Windows

1. Prefer the Microsoft Store installer if available.
2. If you use the GitHub installer, run the `-setup.exe` file and follow the setup wizard.
3. If SmartScreen appears, choose **More info → Run anyway**.

#### Linux

```bash
chmod +x CCX-Desktop-*.AppImage
./CCX-Desktop-*.AppImage
```

AppImage supports in-app auto updates. If you install through deb or rpm packages, use your system package manager instead.

## Configure key

When you open CCX Desktop, the first-run wizard generates and writes `PROXY_ACCESS_KEY`.

![CCX Desktop first-run wizard](/images/desktop/setup-wizard.png)

### What `PROXY_ACCESS_KEY` is used for

- It is the proxy key clients use to access CCX.
- CCX Desktop writes it into client configuration when you apply agent settings.
- If you configure a client manually, set the client API key to the same `PROXY_ACCESS_KEY`.

### Key types to understand

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `PROXY_ACCESS_KEY` | Client proxy key for accessing CCX |
| `ADMIN_ACCESS_KEY` | Admin key used by the web UI and admin endpoints |
| Upstream API key | Provider key configured only inside CCX channels |

You can copy the current `PROXY_ACCESS_KEY` from the tray menu or **Gateway Monitor**, then paste it into the client configuration or shell environment.

## Start service

Open **Gateway Monitor** and click **Start service**.

![Gateway Monitor](/images/desktop/gateway-monitor.png)

If CCX Desktop reports that the binary is missing, build the backend first:

```bash
cd backend-go && make build
```

After startup, check:

- The status indicator is green.
- The gateway port and uptime are visible.
- **Log Viewer** shows no obvious errors.

Gateway Monitor also supports:

- Stop / restart service.
- Live log output.
- Copying the web UI address.

## Agent configuration

Open **Agent Config** to apply local CCX configuration to supported agent tools:

![Agent Config](/images/desktop/agent-config.png)

- **Claude Code**
- **Codex**
- **OpenCode**

Using CCX as the provider is recommended because requests go through the local gateway and can use channel scheduling and failover.

CCX Desktop typically writes:

- The CCX address the client should use.
- The proxy key (`PROXY_ACCESS_KEY`).
- Related model or provider settings.

After applying configuration, restart the matching client so the new settings take effect.

For protocol and Base URL details by client, see:

- [Connect Claude Code to CCX](/en/guide/clients/claude-code)
- [Connect Codex CLI / Codex App to CCX](/en/guide/clients/codex)
- [Connect OpenCode to CCX](/en/guide/clients/opencode)

## Add channels

Open **Channel Center** and add at least one working channel for the target endpoint:

![Channel Center](/images/desktop/channel-center.png)

- Messages channel: for Claude Code
- Responses channel: for Codex CLI / Codex App
- Chat channel: for OpenCode

You can start from preset templates and then fill in:

- Upstream API key
- Base URL
- Model name or model mapping
- Compatibility options

::: tip
The upstream API key is configured only in the channel. The client API key should be set to CCX `PROXY_ACCESS_KEY`.
:::

After adding a channel, confirm that it is healthy in the web UI or logs.

## Verify requests

After completing installation, key setup, service startup, agent configuration, and channel setup, verify the end-to-end path.

### Verify with a client

1. Start CCX Desktop and confirm the service is running.
2. Restart the client (Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode).
3. Send a test prompt such as `hello`.
4. Confirm the request appears in the CCX Desktop **Log Viewer** or web UI.

### Verify from the command line

You can first check the models endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3688/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-ccx-proxy-key"
```

Then confirm the request path expected by each client:

- Claude Code requests should target `/v1/messages`
- Codex requests should target `/v1/responses`
- OpenCode requests should target `/v1/chat/completions`

## Environment configuration

Open **Environment Params** to edit the `.env` file. Common settings:

![Environment Params](/images/desktop/env-params.png)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | 3688 | Gateway port |
| `PROXY_ACCESS_KEY` | - | Client proxy key for accessing CCX |
| `ADMIN_ACCESS_KEY` | - | Admin key |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | info | Log level |

After changing `.env`, restart the service to apply changes.

## Web UI and system tray

### Web UI

You can open the embedded web UI from **Gateway Monitor** to manage channels, inspect logs, and verify service status.

### System tray

After the window is closed, CCX Desktop minimizes to the system tray.

![CCX Desktop sidebar and daemon panel](/images/desktop/sidebar.png)

Common tray actions:

- View service status, port, and PID
- Start / stop / restart service
- Open web UI
- Copy web UI address and `PROXY_ACCESS_KEY`
- Launch-at-login toggle
- Check for updates

## Auto update

The GitHub installer build supports in-app auto updates:

- One automatic check 5 seconds after launch
- Additional checks every 30 minutes
- Manual check from the sidebar version area

The Microsoft Store build does not use the GitHub updater. The sidebar and tray indicate that updates are handled by the Store.

GitHub update flow:

1. A new version is detected and the update dialog appears
2. The update package is downloaded
3. SHA256 verification runs
4. macOS: open the DMG and replace the app manually
5. Windows: the installer launches automatically
6. Linux (AppImage): the app is replaced and restarted

## First-run checklist

Your desktop setup is ready when all of these are true:

- [ ] `PROXY_ACCESS_KEY` has been generated and copied
- [ ] The gateway is running and the **Gateway Monitor** status looks healthy
- [ ] At least one target channel has been added and enabled
- [ ] Agent configuration has been applied and the client has been restarted
- [ ] A client request appears in the CCX Desktop logs

For startup failures, update issues, or agent configuration problems, see [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting).
